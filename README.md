# Pizza-Store-Analysis

Here I have taken the dataset from kaggle and made meaningful indights from the dataset.
I have tranformed data and used DAX queries as well.
Goals related to DataSet and some information for that is added below:

**Goals:**
1-To increase Sales.
2-To find busiest times of day,week and month.
3-Most Selling Pizzas and Category.
4-Most ordered size of Pizza.

**Reporting To/Target Audience** - Store Owner, Dealer

**Tables**: We have sales data, Pizza types and List of Pizzas we sell.

After completion of analysis I have drawn some conclusion as well form the insights:

**Conclusion:**
1)Most selling Pizzas are of Veggie and Supreme Category so some offers can be introduced so the sales of other categories can be boosted.

2)In the Day wise sale we can introduce some offers on Saturdays,Thrusdays or Wednesdays so the sales will increase on these days as well where the most ordered size is LARGE so similar offers can introduced in other sizes as well.

3)Worst performing pizzas should be removed from menu and new ones should be added.

4)Meals or Happy hour offers should be there after 3 pm.
