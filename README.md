# Pizza-Store-Analysis

This dataset has been taken by Kaggle which contains four tables and as per my schema one is fact table and others are dimension table. Tables had relevant data regarding Sales and pizzas which has been cleaned and manipulated further to achieve the goals.

**Objective:**

•	To increase Sales 

•	To find busiest times of day ,week and month.

•	Most Selling Pizzas and Category.

•	Most ordered size of Pizza.

**Methodologies:**

I have used DAX queries and created measures for finding total Sales and Average Order Value.Did data cleaning for finding the Types of pizzas sold.For all doing this Stuff I have used Power BI.

**Reporting To/Target Audience** - Store Owner, Dealer

**Tables**: We have sales data, Pizza types and List of Pizzas we sell.

• Dashboard provides the insights about total Sales and Average Order values.Including all these I have made some charts which provides actionable insights to the Store Owner/Dealer.That how can he increase the Sales and generate more profits for his store or organisation.

**Challenges Faced:** Here I didn’t have cost data like raw materials cost,Utlities Cost,Employee Costs, etc.. That I considered as challenge because I cant find the profit of the store.

**Conclusion:**
•	Most selling Pizzas are of Veggie and Supreme Category so some offers can be introduced so the sales of other categories can be boosted.

•	In the Day wise sale we can introduce some offers on Saturdays,Thrusdays or Wednesdays so the sales will increase on these days as well where the most ordered size is LARGE so similar offers can introduced in other sizes as well.

**Recommendations and Actionable Insights:**

•	Worst performing pizzas should be removed from menu and new ones should be added.

•	Meals or Happy hour offers should be there after 3 pm.

•	Some coupons and discount offers should be introduced during Monday-Thrusday,so we can get consistent sales during the week.
